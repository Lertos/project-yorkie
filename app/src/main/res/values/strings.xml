        The Home Page is used to upgrade your Talents, check your pack of dogs, and see your currency\n\n\n
        There are two currencies: Hearts and Heart Tokens. Both can be gained passively (see the Activities page)\n\n\n
        Talents give an overall bonus to multiple aspects of the game\n\n\n
        Each dog in your pack gives a multiplier bonus to your Hearts per second

    <string name="tutorial_activity_page">
        Activities are the main way to gain more Hearts and Heart Tokens passively (even while offline)\n\n\n
        Each activity has a different curve; don\'t put all your eggs in one basket!

        The Petting minigame turns Heart Tokens into Hearts\n\n\n
        The goal is to tap on the square that appears as quick as possible\n\n\n
        Every square clicked will increase the speed\n\n\n
        Every 10 squares will bump you into a new "threshold" so future runs can be set to the right difficulty
