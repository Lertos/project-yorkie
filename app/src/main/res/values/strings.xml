        The Home Page is used to upgrade your Talents, check your pack of dogs, and see your current amount of each currency.\n\n\n
        Talents give an overall bonus to multiple aspects of the game. Upgrade these with your heart currency.\n\n\n
        Your pack of dogs gives a multiplier bonus to your hearts per second. Unlock more by winning Tournaments.\n\n\n
        There are two currencies: hearts and heart tokens. Both can be gained passively (see the Activities page).
